Event management is the application of project management to the creation and development of large or small scale events such as festivals, conferences, ceremonies, formal parties, concerts, or conventions. The last few years have seen a rapid growth in the event management industry. Considering the existing system problems related to event management we are developing an android application for event management.
This application currently focuses on Esports , Stand-up and general events. The application is developed using C++.
